;;unsigned integers

(+ u2 u3)

;; result is u5   meaning unsigned 5 integer

;;Subtraction

(+ u2 u3) 
;; answer is u5 unisigned meaning it cannot be negative.

;;Substraction
(- 5 10)
;; Answer is -5    This is sample of signed integreers

;; Built-in Functions in Clarity
(* u2 u16)
;; Answer is u32

;; Division
(/ 100 4)
;; Answer is 25

(/ u100 u3)
;; Answer is u33

;; Note that there are no decimals only integers are allowed.

Booleans
//bool, short for boolean. A boolean value is either true or false. They are used to check if a certain condition is met or unmet (true //or false). Some built-in functions that accept booleans:
//not (inverts a boolean):

(not true)
;; result is false

//and (returns true if all inputs are true):
(and true true true)

;; result is true.

//or (returns true if at least one input is true):
(or false true false)


Principals
A principal is a special type in Clarity and represents a Stacks address on the blockchain. 

 It is a unique identifier you can roughly equate to an email address or bank account numberâ€”although definitely not the same! You might have also heard the term wallet address as well. Clarity admits two different kinds of principals: standard principals and contract principals

Standard Principals are backed by corresponding private keys.

Contract Principals point to a Smart Contract.

 Principals follow a specific structure and always start with the characters SP for the Stacks mainnet and ST for the testnet and mocknet1.


A literal principal value is prefixed by a single quote (') in Clarity. Notice there is no closing single quote.

'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE

Contract principals are a compound of the standard principal that deployed the contract and the contract name, delimited by a dot:

'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.my-awesome-contract

To retrieve the current STX balance of a principal, we can pass it to the stx-get-balance function.

(stx-get-balance 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE)

;; Answer u0

Both kinds of principals can hold tokens, we can thus also check the balance of a contract.

(stx-get-balance 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.my_contract)
;; Answer u0

Zero balances are a little boring, so let us send some some STX to a principal:

(stx-transfer? u500 tx-sender 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE)

0.0005 STXST000000000000000000002AMW42HST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE
