;;Strings  A string is a sequence of characters. These can be defined as ASCII strings or UTF-8 strings. ASCII strings may only contain basic Latin characters whilst UTF-8 strings can contain fun stuff like emoji. Both strings are enclosed in double-quotes (") but UTF-8 strings are also prefixed by a u.

ASCII
"This is an ASCII string"


UTF
u"And this is an UTF-8 string \u{1f601}"
